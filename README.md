This was an intermediate project created for Free Code Camp's Front End Development Certification.

Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/wGqEga/

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.

User Story: I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

Hint #1: Here's a URL you can use to get a random Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random

Hint #2: Here's an entry on using Wikipedia's API: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page

Hint #3: Use this link to experiment with Wikipedia's API.

As time wore on and I learned more on my own, I decided that I had to upscale some projects, including this one. I added modularization and a Gulp workflow (looove Gulp), and revamped the visuals/functionality for the search bar. Once you get a taste of what all this does for you regarding your code and time saving, there is no going back!
